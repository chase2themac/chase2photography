                <h2 class="Basic-Header"> Why did I even start this?</h2>
                <p class="Filler-Text"> For a brief background of what this even is... well i guess this is an experiment involving all my personal interests. A while ago i had started doing some super basic coding stuff for Thinkful! This involved HTML, CSS, JS, Node, Mongodb, and something else I can't remember. As for the subject of this project it will be my love of Photography!!! So sit back and enjoy the ride! </p>

            <div class="SecondNote">
                <h2 class="Basic-Header2">Photography???</h2>
                <p class="Filler-Text"> I have had a huge interest in Photography for many many years now. Yet it wasn't until the past couple years that I had invested any time or interest into getting better. Even still it wasn't until I met someone very dear too me that I started publisizing any of my photos. So obviously I am taking baby steps towards becoming more serious in my photography. This is the step that will push me in both skill in this art form, and build skill in the art of coding.</p>

                <h2 class="Basic-Header3">What's next?</h2>
                <p class="Filler-Text">Well for starters I will be working on this site a couple days a week. Which involves working on the front end as I build the back. Like def start pushing updates hopefully by the end of the day. (03/24/21)</p>
